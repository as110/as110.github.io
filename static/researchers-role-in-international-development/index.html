        <p>In class, we discussed whether we, student researchers abroad, have a role in international development. <br>
In my case, do I have an <em>obligation</em> to  influence policy surrounding water access and conservation?  </p>

<h3 id="nope">Nope</h3>

<p>I got hired by Busoga Trust to evaluate technologies to improve water irrigation in rural communities. I've taken classes and done projects at Rice that have given me experience in doing this project. Furthermore, I will need to do a policy analysis to understand the obstacles to irrigation that currently exist. <strong>But</strong>, I think that influencing the policy in the country is best left to the NGO. My attempts to do so will be seen as American meddling in Ugandan affairs. We talked a lot about how to be an ethical traveler. Attempting to meddle in politics will definitely make things worse. </p>
